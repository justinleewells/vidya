# Vidya

Vidya is an opinionated framework for creating video games with JavaScript built on top of Phaser 3.

In practice, Vidya is a CLI that heavily relies on templates to create and manage game data in a quick, structured way.

## Installation

```
npm install -g vidya
```

## Bootstrap

```
vidya bootstrap <name>
```

## Create

```
vidya create <type> <name>
```

##  Rename

```
vidya rename <type> <old> <new>
```

## Sync

```
vidya sync <type>
```

## Note

This framework was created to solidify the patterns that I've found myself reimplementing ad nauseam throughout the years as a squarely amateur game developer. The primary reason for Vidya's existence is to increase my own productivity.

I'll do my best to keep these docs up to date and maybe add a tutorial or two, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend anyone use Vidya over something like Unity unless you deeply love JavaScript and are willing to put in the time to understand how this framework and the other frameworks it utilizes work together.
